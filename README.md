# C Programming: A Modern Approach - solutions to exercises and projects

In this repo you will find my solutions to most (not all) of the exercises and projects in chapter 1 through 15 for the book C Programming: A Modern Approach by K.N Knight

Note:
I will only be using the knowledge present in the current chapter for the solutions, even if there is a more efficient way to solve the exercises.
The exercise descriptions themselves won't be included, only my solutions.
