1 a) 1 2 (float rounds down)
  b) 0 (12 % 3 = 0)
  c) 17 % 9 / 8 = 1
  d) 6 % 4 / 3 = 2 / 3 = 0.666... (float rounds down) = 0

2 In C89 values can differ since it will either round up or down but in c99 it will always be the same (rounded down) -(i/j) will always be
  the same.

3 a) 1
  b) -1 or -2
  c) -1 or -2
  d) 1 or 2

4 a) 1
  b) -1
  c) -1
  d) 1

5 and 6 skipped because too repetetive

7) since the check digit can only be a single digit number we cant subtract the remainder from 10 in the end, then the check digit could possibly be 10

8) yes it would work

9 a) 63 8
  b) 3 2 1
  c) 2 -1 3
  d) 0 0 0

13) ++i and i += 1 are equal, the value of i is immediatly updated in the expression to be incremented with 1
